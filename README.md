# React + Vite

This is a simple task manager. To install it locally, after cloning it. 

1. Open the Project Directory, *taskList-master*:

   - Navigate to the directory where you cloned the project using your terminal or command prompt.

2. Install Dependencies:

   - Run the following command in your terminal:
     
     npm install     

   - This will download and install all the necessary packages listed in the `package.json` file.

3. Check for Errors:

   - After the installation, check your terminal for any errors. If there are any issues, you might need to:
     - Fix package versions: Ensure the package versions in `package.json` are compatible with your system.
     - Check for missing packages: Look for any missing or outdated dependencies in your `package.json`.


Starting the Project:

Once the dependencies are installed, you can start the development server by running the following command:

npm start 


This will usually launch a development server in your browser, allowing you to view and interact with your React application.

Let me know if you encounter any issues during the installation process or when starting the project!

You can alternatively 
- Run 
    *npm run*
to see available commands
- Finally run the command to build the project. Typically is 
    *npm run build*
